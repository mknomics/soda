# soda 
The purpose of this repository is to help teach students data science and some basic economics including flaws in how to estimate market demand.  As such, none of this code should be relied upon to conduct robust estimations of market demand.  The obvious methodological flaws in these files may be documented here in the future but for now, I reserve such content for in-class lectures.


This data is  taken from https://www.kaggle.com/veeralakrishna/predict-demand and is uploaded here simply to help students learn how to import csv files from Github using Colab. 
The dataset includes 7561 observations of soda price sales and price for specific shops in various cities over time.
